# Enigma-machine
It is an app which will allow to encode messages specially, based on the Enigma machine from WW2

## How it works
#### Encryption
It will scramble your message in message.txt based on a list of chars, including spaces and excluding newlines.
It will then output an encrypted message in encrypt.txt

#### Decryption
It will read encrypt.txt and decrypt it based on uniqu character combination which is determined when you initially create it.
Basically, you have to have the same configuration of the 'chars' list in both encrypt.py and decrypt.py for it to decrypt to a readable message, and with 100 possible characters, there are about 4.67e+158 possible ways of decrypting it!

## How to do?(TO BE ADDED)
<del>
To get a messaging system on a bunch of computers, check the releases page, get the latest release and simple click scramble.py to get a fresh set of encrypt.py and decrypt.py.
Copy pasta them to however many pc's you want to, as they will contain the same 'chars' list, so will be literally made for each other.
If you have more, it is advisable to put the files in separate directories so they don't get confused.</del>
